## VERSION 0.1
#### WE IN ALPHA BOYS

##### What is "bedit"?

Bedit is simply a currency, used as a way to challenge people with dares, bets, etc, without putting any actual money at stake.

##### How does it work?

At the start of each week, each person's bedit count is set to 100 B. Throughout the week, people can challenge each other to dares, or bets. For example,
* "5 bedit that you won't kick the chair"
* "10 bedit that you won't text the lyrics of "Into You" to Ashley"
* 100 bedit you kick Mahir in his non-exsistent balls
* "I bet you 5 bedit that we can't spend 30 seconds on /b/ without seeing a dick"

These are all example, valid bets and dares. For a guide on how much you should value your dares and bets at, see <IDEK FIGURE SOMETHING OUT>

##### Why does it matter?

The person who accumulates the most bedit in a month will gain some prize.

##### IDK man, this seems pretty boring

Don't worry; this is still a WIP. We eventually intend for much more to be added, including but not limited to
* Investing of bedit in people
* Loaning bedit
* Betting against the bank

and all sorts of cool things.

##### Alright, I'm in. Now what?
