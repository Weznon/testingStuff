### Goals

Given a list of people, the program will then return a modified list of people, depending on what happens. A log of specific actions will also be produced

### Process
At the beginning of each "day", a random event is rolled. For example, it might roll "Festival Day" or "Goblin Attack". These each have different effects on the rest of the day. A festival day might result in the consumption of more food than normal, and a goblin attack might result in injuries, death, and looted storage.

If nothing occurs, which is what happens the majority of the time, each citizen will perform their job. A blacksmith will work on making an item, bakers will make food, farmers will produce raw materials.
