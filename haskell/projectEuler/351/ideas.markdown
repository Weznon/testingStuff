### Ideas
* You only need to calculate one out of the 6 sections of the hexagon, you can then multiply by six
    * You might even be able to split into 12th(down the middle of a 6th)
* Maybe make new coordinate system?
* Have a list of visibles or hiddens, see which is more effecient
* Make a formula for the number of points in a sector
