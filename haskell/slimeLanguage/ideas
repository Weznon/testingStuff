"lore" of lanaugage is that the program is executed by a slime going through a dungeon

when enemy is encountered something happens

2-d language

slime starts at ^, initially moves to right. can be redirected with |, -, /, \
. is ignored, so 
example path
  /...^...|
  .    /...\
  .    .   .
  .    .   .
  \..../.../
       .
       .
       .
       End
this starts by going to right, reflected to move left
then follows the dots 

enemies can be used as a standalone character, like A or B, or can be [A15] or [Cl] if they take arguements

arguments levels?
