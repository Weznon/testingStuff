evaluate the left side, the multiplicand/multiplier

have to do 2 - 5 digits on the left side

generate all the possible ones, then check to see if its pandigital?

max digits on left is 5 i think
 
since 100 * 100 = 10000 which is 11 digits

so thus 

2 digits cant be it either
since 2 digits at max result in 2 on right
so 4 total

same for 3/4
so it has to be 5 on left

coolio

that makes it much easier

so find all orderings of 

i think thats 15120 possible orderinsg

thats actually not that many

coolio

i could generate all unique groups of 5 then shuffle

or generate all unique orders of the groups of 5 and split on different parts

which would be easier

hrm

definitely doing the all orders even though there will be 

95678 and 98765 will be generated

use list comprehensions to generate? i tihnk that could work 

i think i have this planned out
